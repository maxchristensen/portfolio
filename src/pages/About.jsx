            Hey! My name is Max, and I am a Graphic Designer and Web Developer based in the windy city of Te Whanganui-a-Tara. <br /> <br />
            I am always trying to push the limits of what websites and applications can look like, by bringing in hints of minimalist graphic design to enhance and evolve the digital space. <br /> <br />
            Whenever Iâ€™m not working on crazy, over-the-top projects. You can catch world-building, currently building a homebrew dungeons & dragons world called Drukhanis. <br /> <br />
            I am also a Formula One fanatic, currently cheering on Aston Martin and Ferrari!
